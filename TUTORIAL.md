# SegNeXt Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on using SegNeXt for semantic segmentation. Even if you're new to practical machine learning, this guide will help you get started.

## What is Semantic Segmentation?

Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. For example, in a city scene, we might label pixels as road, building, pedestrian, car, etc.

## Setup

Before starting, ensure you've completed the setup steps in the `SETUP_GUIDE.md` file. This will ensure you have:
1. The correct dataset structure
2. All required directories
3. The necessary configuration

## Step-by-Step Training Guide

### 1. Understand Your Dataset

The Cityscapes dataset is designed for urban street scene understanding:
- It contains 5,000 finely annotated images
- There are 19 classes for evaluation (plus a background class)
- Images are from 50 different cities
- It's split into training, validation, and test sets

The classes include road, sidewalk, building, wall, fence, pole, traffic light, traffic sign, vegetation, terrain, sky, person, rider, car, truck, bus, train, motorcycle, and bicycle.

### 2. Configure Your Training

The `config.yaml` file contains all the parameters for training. For beginners, the most important ones are:

- `batch_size`: Start with a small value (2-4) if you have limited GPU memory
- `epochs`: How many times to go through the training data (50 is a good start)
- `learning_rate`: The step size for optimization (0.001 is the default)
- `img_height` and `img_width`: The dimensions of the input images

### 3. Start Training

Simply run:
```
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load the datasets
2. Initialize the model
3. Start the training process
4. Periodically evaluate on the validation set
5. Save checkpoints when the model improves

You'll see progress displayed in the terminal, including:
- Current epoch
- Training loss
- Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) - the main evaluation metric

### 4. Monitor Training Progress

During training, keep an eye on:
- **Training loss**: Should generally decrease
- **Validation mIoU**: Should increase over time
- **Learning rate**: Will decrease according to your schedule

If the validation mIoU stops improving for many epochs, training might have plateaued.

### 5. Run Inference

Once training is complete, you can use the model to segment new images:

```
python inference.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg --checkpoint checkpoints/my_segmentation_model/best_model.pth
```

This will:
1. Load your trained model
2. Process the input image
3. Generate and visualize the segmentation

## Understanding the Model Architecture

SegNeXt has three main components:

1. **Backbone**: Extracts features from the input image at different scales
2. **Context Module**: Captures long-range dependencies using the Hamburger module
3. **Decoder**: Combines features to generate the final segmentation

## Tips for Better Results

- **Data augmentation**: Already implemented in the code, helps prevent overfitting
- **Learning rate scheduling**: The cosine schedule gradually reduces the learning rate
- **Checkpoint saving**: The code automatically saves the best model based on validation performance
- **Batch normalization**: Helps stabilize training

## Troubleshooting

- **Out of memory errors**: Reduce batch size or image resolution
- **Poor performance**: Try training for more epochs or adjusting the learning rate
- **Slow training**: Consider using a smaller image resolution for initial experiments

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basic workflow:

1. Try different hyperparameters
2. Experiment with different loss functions in `losses.py`
3. Apply the model to your own datasets
4. Explore the model architecture to understand it better

Remember, deep learning is iterative - don't expect perfect results immediately!
